Please download the training, validation, and testing splits from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1x9CDytJ_NoxCvPigAwLCtoYohfnHbtjA/view?usp=sharing). These splits are stored in `csv` files so that results are reproducible. Also, the validation and testing split **do not** contain files from the `ESC50` and `RESP` datasets. The folders `3,4,5,6,7,8` should be located here. Please refer to the `README.txt` file for an explanation of the folder names.
