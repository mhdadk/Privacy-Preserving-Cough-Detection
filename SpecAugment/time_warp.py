"""
Given a Mel-scale spectrogram with shape mel_spec_height x tau, time warping is
done as follows:

1. Pick a column on the time axis at random from column number W to column
   number tau - W, where W is the time warp parameter that is chosen beforehand.
   In the original paper, W ranges from 0 to 80. Let the chosen column number
   be alpha. This means that the Mel-spectrogram is now partitioned into two
   windows defined by the coordinates:
       
   1st window:
       row 0, column 0
       row mel_spec_height, column 0
       row 0, column alpha
       row mel_spec_height, column alpha
       
   2nd window:
       row 0, column alpha+1
       row mel_spec_height, column alpha+1
       row 0, column tau
       row mel_spec_height, column tau

2. The 1st window is to be warped to the left or right by a distance w that is
   sampled from a discrete uniform distribution with a support of [-W,W].
3. According to the original paper, to perform this warping, 6 control points
   are placed on the edges of the window. 4 of these control points will be
   placed on the corners of the window, and the other 2 will be placed at the
   mid-points of the vertical edges of the window. However, the implementation
   used here uses a different set of control points. This does not affect the
   outcome.
5. The Tensorflow Addons function tensorflow_addons.image.sparse_image_warp()
   is then used to perform time warping.
