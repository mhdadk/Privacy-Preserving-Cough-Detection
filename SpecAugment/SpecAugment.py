        The following list contains the proportions of the total number of augmentations
        that are time warped (TW), time masked (TM), and frequency masked (FM). These
        transformations are considered as random variables with associated probability
        distributions P(TW), P(TM), and P(FM) respectively. These are Bernoulli random
        variables, where each transformation can either be applied (1) or not applied
        (0).
        
        The first element of the list corresponds to the proportion of the total number
        of augmentations that are time warped, or P(TW = 1). The second element of the
        list corresponds to the proportion of the total number of augmentations that are
        time masked, or P(TM = 1). The third element of the list corresponds to the
        proportion of the total number of augmentations that are frequency masked, or
        P(FM = 1). For example, if:
            
        p = [0.4,0.6,0.7]
        
        Then this means that of the total number of num_aug augmentations,
        40% will be time warped, 60% will be time masked, and 70% will be
        frequency masked. Note that:
        
        P(TW = 0) = 1 - P(TW = 1)
        P(TM = 0) = 1 - P(TM = 1)
        P(FM = 0) = 1 - P(FM = 1)
        
        IMPORTANT NOTE: Because the probability of not time warping, not time
        masking, and not frequency masking a spectrogram is set to 0, then the
        sum of these probabilities MUST be at least 1.5. In other words, 
        sum(p) > 1.5.

        self.p = p
        
        """
        The possible transformations that can be applied are shown in the table below.
        TW stands for time warping, TM stands for time masking, and FM stands for
        frequency masking. A 1 indicates that the corresponding transformation is
        applied, while a 0 indicates that the corresponding transformation is not
        applied.
        
        TW  TM  FM
        -----------

        0   0   1

        1   1   0
        1   1   1
        
        Since these transformations can be applied in combinations, then a joint
        distribution for these transformations P(TW,TM,FM) also exists. However, these
        transformations are assumed to be independent from each other, such that the
        occurence of one transformation does not imply anything about the occurence of
        another transformation. This means that:
        
        P(TW,TM,FM) = P(TW) x P(TM) x P(FM)
        
        To avoid no augmentations occuring at all, which is when TW = 0 and TM = 0 and
        FM = 0, then the joint probability of these events should be set to 0:
            
        P(TW = 0,TM = 0,FM = 0) = 0
        
        However, the probability mass associated with P(TW = 0,TM = 0,FM = 0) must now
        be re-distributed to the rest of the probability distribution. Since there
        are 7 outcomes in total, then the following probability mass is re-distributed:
            
        P(TW = 0,TM = 0,FM = 0) / 7 = P(TW = 0) x P(TM = 0) x P(FM = 0) / 7
        
        This is equivalent to re-distributing:
            
        (1 - P(TW = 1)) x (1 - P(TM = 1)) x (1 - P(FM = 1)) / 7
        
        Re-distribution is done by adding this probability mass to the probability mass
        of each of the other outcomes.

        Given a Mel-scale spectrogram with shape v x tau, time
        warping is done as follows:
        
        1. Pick a column on the time axis at random from column number W to column
           number tau - W, where W is the time warp parameter that is chosen
           beforehand. In the original paper, W ranges from 0 to 80. Let the chosen
           column number be alpha. This means that the Mel-spectrogram is now
           partitioned into two windows defined on the time axis as:
               
           1st window:
               column 0 --> column alpha
               
           2nd window:
               column alpha + 1 --> column tau
        
        2. The 1st window is to be warped to the left or right by a distance w that
           is sampled from a discrete uniform distribution with a support of [-W,W].
           The 2nd window is warped in the opposite direction by the same amount
           as the 1st window.
        3. To perform this warping, control points are placed on each pixel in the
           alpha column. The final locations of these pixels after warping are also
           specified. Finally, the Tensorflow Addons function
           tensorflow_addons.image.sparse_image_warp() is then used to perform time
           warping.
